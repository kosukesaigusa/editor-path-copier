A VS Code extension that allows you to easily copy file paths from the editor toolbar.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Two copy modes** - Copy absolute or relative paths as needed
- ðŸ’¬ **Instant feedback** - Notification displays the copied path for confirmation
- âš¡ **Lightweight** - No configuration needed, works out of the box

## Usage

1. Open any file in VS Code
2. Look for the copy icons in the editor toolbar (top-right area)
