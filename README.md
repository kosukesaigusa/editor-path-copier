A VS Code extension that allows you to easily copy file paths from the editor toolbar.

## Features

- ðŸ“‹ **One-click copy** - Add buttons to the editor toolbar for instant path copying
- ðŸŽ¯ **Two copy modes** - Copy absolute or relative paths as needed
- ðŸ’¬ **Instant feedback** - Notification displays the copied path for confirmation
- âš¡ **Lightweight** - No configuration needed, works out of the box

## Usage

1. Open any file in VS Code
2. Look for the copy icons in the editor toolbar (top-right area)
3. Click to copy either:
   - **First icon**: Absolute path (full system path)
   - **Second icon**: Relative path (relative to workspace root)
4. The path is automatically copied to your clipboard

## Installation

### From VS Code Marketplace

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X)
